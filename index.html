        <h1>About My Major</h1>
        <p>
          My interest in software development began when I was working on my graduation project, which was a medical application. <br>
          So, I had to learn and read about android mobile applications and I did. <br>
          I started working and learning how to use Android Studio to make a medical application with different features that can help patients to ease their life. <br>
          Even healthy people can use this app as a medicine dictionary. <br>
          I have finished my work within 4 months and I had get “A” in graduation project and I am so proud of that. <br>
        </p>
